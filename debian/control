Description: Embeddable, replicated and fault tolerant SQL engine - shared library
 Embeddable SQL database engine with high availability and automatic failover.
 .
 The cowsql library extends SQLite with a network protocol that can connect
 together various instances of your application and have them act as a
 highly-available cluster, with no dependency on external databases. The
 name "cowsql" loosely refers to the "pets vs. cattle" concept, since it's
 generally fine to delete or rebuild a particular node of an application that
 uses cowsql for data storage.
 .
 This package contains the C library needed to run executables that use cowsql.
